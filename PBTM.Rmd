## Population-based Threshold Models - R Package *beta 

Population-based Threshold Models Calculator (PBTM). This R package combines most existing PBT models with calculation and plot of these models.

Initial step:
Set working folder - Add the folder location of your data files

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
