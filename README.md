### Overview

Population-based threshold model Calculator - Beta version

The **PBTM** package was developed to calculate population-based threshold models (PBTM) from datasets. The models used here have been initially developed to work germination rate data. 

To learn how to use the package, prepare your data and calculate the models, please see the [R PBTM website](https://pedrobello.github.io/PBTM/index.html)
