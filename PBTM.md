Population-based Threshold Models Calculator (PBTM). This R package combines most existing PBT models with calculation and plot of these models.

Initial step:
Set working folder - Add the folder location of your data files


```r
summary(cars)
```

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
